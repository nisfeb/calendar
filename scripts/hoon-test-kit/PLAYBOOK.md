# Playbook

How to put a Hoon app's tests on the kit, find what they miss, and close it.
Every rule here comes from something that went wrong at least once on auspex
(2026-09-25). Keep it current: when a run teaches something new, add it
here in the same change.

## Rolling out to an app

Do these in order. Each step has a condition for moving on.

1. **Make the libs reachable.** A test build reaches only what is on the
   test desk. Libs that import nothing are easiest. A lib that imports
   other libs or a `sur/` file works if those are listed in `LIBS` or
   `FILES` too. Logic inside the agent or nexus cannot be tested this way
   at all: move it into a lib first. *Done when* every lib you want tested
   builds on the desk.
2. **Set up the kit and run a baseline.** Vendor the kit, write
   `hoon-test.conf`, then `|new-desk` and `|mount` the test desk, run
   `setup`, then run the suites. *Done when* `hoon-test.sh <pier>` exits 0
   and the count of `OK` lines in the ship's terminal matches the number of
   `++  test-` arms in the files.
3. **Run the cheap mutation pass.** `hoon-mutate.py <pier> --list`, then
   the default ops (`boundary,conjunct`). They aim at caps and guards, and
   give the most real findings per commit. *Done when* every survivor is
   triaged (below).
4. **Close the real gaps**, then rerun only the arms you fixed with
   `--only`. *Done when* every mutant there is killed or has been moved to
   equivalent with a reason.
5. **Run the rest of the menu**: `--ops branch,equal,flag`. Check the
   no-build rate per op first (below). Triage, close, and recheck as
   before.
6. **Write down what the run found**: in the app's own docs, what
   survived and why each equivalent is equivalent. Anything new about the
   *method* goes in this file.

## Reading a mutation run

Each mutant ends in one of four ways:

| verdict | meaning |
|---|---|
| `killed` | some test failed. Good. |
| `SURVIVED` | every test passed with the code broken: a gap, or a mutant that changes nothing |
| `no-build` | the mutant does not compile, and is discarded |
| `timeout` | it ran past the limit; the kit sends ^C to the ship (SIGINT to the king process) |

**Check the run's health before reading survivors:**

- **Implausibly fast results (0 s) mean the ship, not the tests.** A dead
  ship used to make every later mutant "killed". Now the runner exits 4
  and the rest of the run is void.
- **A high no-build rate for one op means the site finder is wrong.** The
  first `equal` regex matched the `=(` inside `|=(` gates: 66 of its 87
  mutants never compiled, so most of that op silently never ran. Above a
  handful of no-builds, fix the pattern and rerun that op alone.
- **A verdict that changes between `--only <arm>` and the full run means
  the run is contaminated.** Until 2026-09-25 the runner left each lib's
  last mutant on the desk when it moved on to the next lib, so every later
  mutant ran against two breaks: on the calendar, `rules`' last mutant
  "killed" every `rrule` mutant, and `rrule`'s last one (which did not
  build) made every later mutant a no-build. Fixed: the previous lib is
  restored before each mutant. **Rerun any multi-lib pass made before the
  fix** (auspex's included): its killed counts are too high.
- **Some no-builds are expected.** Swapping `?.`/`?:` after a `?=` test
  breaks the type narrowing the other branch relies on, so those mutants
  can't compile. That is correct. The same goes for a tall `?&` condition
  that spans lines: the text-based finder splits it, and both halves fail
  to build.

## Triaging a survivor

**Re-trace every survivor before writing a test for it.** Read the arm and
its callers, and ask whether the mutant can change any output. On auspex,
17 of 44 survivors turned out to be equivalent. A test written for one of
those is written against code that cannot fail.

These kinds of mutant are equivalent, with no output that could differ:

- **A fast path that repeats a check** the loop makes anyway.
- **A comparator behind an equality guard.** `?.  =(a b)  (lth a b)` can
  never compare equal values, so `lth` and `lte` agree there.
- **A running maximum or minimum**: `gth` and `gte` pick the same value
  on a tie.
- **A path that gives the same result at the boundary**, such as shedding
  down to N when there are exactly N.
- **A bound that limits cost, not the answer**, like a `scag` before a
  walk. It is real, but output can't show it.
- **A `$~` default on a mold that is never bunted.** Grep the app for
  `*<mold>`. If the mold is bunted, the default is a real contract, so
  test the bunt. If it is only ever clammed with `;;`, the mutant is
  equivalent.

What is left is a real gap, usually one of these:

- **A whole check no test reaches.** A test that looks complete, such as a
  "bounds" test, may never touch one of the bounds: delete it and every
  test still passes.
- **A boundary only tested from one side.** "cap + 1 is refused" does not
  fail when `lte` becomes `lth`.
- **A branch only tested one way**, such as a search tested with a query
  that hits but never with one that misses.
- **An arm with no test at all.** Mutation finds these even when a
  coverage count says the lib is well covered.

A check that is only defensive, reachable only if some earlier validation
was skipped, can stay untested. Say so in the triage notes.

## Writing tests: traps

- **`weld`/`zing` over literal tapes can `fuse-loop`** the type checker
  (`;:  weld  "a"  x  "b"  ==` did, and so did `(zing (reap n "é"))`
  inside a `weld`). Cast: `` `tape`(zing `(list tape)`(reap n "é")) ``.
- **`%+  expect  !>` is wrong**: `expect` takes one vase. Write
  `(expect !>(…))`.
- **`?=(%a -.(expr))` and `*mold(field x)` do not parse**: `?=` needs a
  wing, and a bunt takes no changes. Bind the value with `=/` first.
  (From auspex.)
- **Before trusting a count, check what a structure really holds.** A
  day span puts both its edges in the calendar's index, so a year of
  dates is two keys, not one. The first run of a new suite is as likely to
  find a test's wrong assumption as a bug; read the expected/actual.
- **A new suite can find real bugs before any mutant runs.** The
  calendar's first run found `FREQ=weekly` refused (RFC 5545 values are
  case-insensitive).

## Writing the missing test

- **Put it in the test that already owns the rule.** Add a new test only
  when nothing owns it.
- **Test caps as a pair**: exactly the cap is accepted, and one past it is
  refused.
- **For ordering, test the promise, not the key.** Which field breaks a
  tie is arbitrary; that every ship gets the same order is not. "Same
  output for both arrival orders" passes for any total order and fails
  for one that leaves two elements unordered.
- **For n distinct ships**: `(sy (turn (gulf 1 n) |=(i=@ `@p`i)))`.
- **Prove it with the mutant.** Run the suite on the real code (it must
  pass), then `hoon-mutate.py --only <arm>`: the mutant must now be
  killed. A test that never failed proves nothing.

## Look after the ship

Every mutant is a commit, and every commit costs loom. A full menu on one
app is a couple of hundred commits.

- **Use a ship nothing else is building on**, ideally one kept only for
  tests, and `|meld` it before a long run. `~wex` died mid-run at
  `--loom 33` with `loom: external fault`, about 150 test-desk commits
  into a day, while another session rebuilt a nexus on the same ship.
- **A crash is stop-and-report.** Only the ship's owner restarts a pier.
- **Never type into a dojo someone may be using.** `|new-desk` and `|mount`
  are the owner's to run: if the pane shows input you did not send (a
  `|pack`, a half-typed line), stop and ask.
- **In a shell tool, `rm` may be `rm -i`** and wait forever on a prompt,
  and `pkill -f <pattern>` kills the tool's own shell when the pattern is
  in its command line. Use `rm -f`, and put a `pkill` in a script file.
- **A clean mount is not a clean desk.** After a crash the mount can hold
  clean files while clay still holds the last mutant. rsync then sees no
  change and never commits. `NOSYNC=1 hoon-test.sh <pier>` commits the
  mount as it stands and settles it. `hoon-mutate.py` restores this way
  itself when a run ends.

## Traps in building the runner

These are already handled in the scripts. They are here for anyone
changing them.

- **khan-eval takes the hoon as one cord.** Every newline must become
  *two* spaces: one space is not a gap, and the parse fails with
  `syntax error {1 N}`. The cord cannot contain `'`.
- **In a bash heredoc, escape Hoon's `$(` as `\$(`** (and backticks), or
  bash runs it.
- **`~[ x]` with a leading space is a syntax error, and so is `~[]`.**
  An empty generated list must be written `~`.
- **A backslash escape in the thread's hoon is read by the outer cord.**
  `"\0a"` arrives as a raw newline inside a tape, and the parse fails.
  Write `(trip 10)`.
- **A product that is itself `[%leaf tape]` arrives bare** (`%leaf 79 75 …
  0`, no brackets), unlike a failed thread's leaf. The report decodes both.
- **The commit lands after the poke acks.** The runner polls `/cz/<desk>`
  until the hash moves, and skips the commit when nothing changed, or it
  would wait forever.
- **`%json` needs `%mime`.** `mar/json.hoon` declares `++grad %mime`.
  Without it, any `/*` of a json file fails its whole test file as
  `FAILED … (build)`: one line, easy to miss among the OKs.
- **Copy support files from `%base`, never vendor them.** `lib/test.hoon`
  and the marks are tied to the ship's kelvin.
- **`%test` returns only a flag.** Per-test lines go to the ship's
  terminal. A failed thread's tang comes back as `[%leaf <bytes> 0]`; the
  runner decodes it into text.
- **Name sites by `+$` and `+*` as well as `++`**, or a default inside a
  mold is credited to the next arm.

## Not built yet

- **CI.** The runner needs no dojo, so a fake ship booted in Actions can
  run it. tlon-apps' `backend/run-tests.sh` boots one from a pier archive.
- **An allowlist of reviewed equivalent mutants**, keyed by arm and op,
  so they stop being re-reported.
- **More operators**: arithmetic, list operations, a deleted line.
