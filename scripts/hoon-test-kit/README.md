# hoon-test-kit

Run a Hoon app's unit suites on a running fake ship **in seconds, with no
dojo**, and check that they actually catch breaks.

- `hoon-test.sh`: syncs the libs under test, their tests and fixtures into
  a desk that holds nothing else, commits it, runs every `test-` arm over
  the pier's `conn.sock`, and prints each test's verdict (with expected and
  actual for a failure) on stdout. On auspex, 156 tests take about 7 s,
  against roughly two minutes for a commit to the app's own desk.
- `grubbery_clay.py`: for a grubbery app, rewrites each lib's grubbery
  imports (`/<`, `/&`) into clay's on the way to the test desk, so libs
  written for grubbery's builder test unchanged.
- `hoon-mutate.py`: breaks one thing at a time in those libs (a boundary,
  a guard's condition, a branch, an equality, a flag), reruns the suites,
  and reports every break that no test noticed.

[PLAYBOOK.md](PLAYBOOK.md) is the procedure: rolling this out to an app,
reading and triaging the results, and every trap we hit building it. Read
it before the first run on a new app.

## Requirements

A running fake ship, and on the machine: `bash`, `python3`, `socat`,
`rsync`, `perl`, and a vere binary. The kit only uses vere for its
`eval --jam/--cue` framing. Set `VERE=<path>`; otherwise the kit uses the
newest `vere-*-linux-x86_64` in the directory that holds the pier.

## Installing it in an app

Vendor the kit, write one config file, and set up a desk once per ship.

```sh
# from the app repo
rsync -a --delete --exclude .git ~/software/personal/hoon-test-kit/ scripts/hoon-test-kit/
git -C ~/software/personal/hoon-test-kit rev-parse --short HEAD > scripts/hoon-test-kit/.kit-version
cp scripts/hoon-test-kit/hoon-test.conf.example hoon-test.conf   # then edit it
```

Rerun the same two lines to update, then commit the vendored copy. The kit
is vendored rather than fetched so an app's tests never change under it.

Then, once per ship. In its dojo:

```
|new-desk %<app>-test
|mount %<app>-test
```

and from the repo:

```sh
scripts/hoon-test-kit/hoon-test.sh <pier> setup
```

Setup copies `lib/test.hoon` and the config's `MARKS` in from the ship's
own `%base`, so they always match its kelvin. It skips anything already
present, so it is safe to rerun.

## hoon-test.conf

At the app repo's root. `bash` sources it and `python` parses it, so it
holds plain `KEY="value"` lines only. Paths are relative to the file.

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `DESK` | the test desk, e.g. `auspex-test`. Never the app's own desk. |
| `LIBS` | the libs under test, space-separated, each `src` or `src=dest`. With no dest a lib lands at `lib/<name>.hoon` (for a grubbery app, at its path under `CODE`). These are what `hoon-mutate.py` mutates. List any lib they import too. |
| `DIALECT` | `clay` (default), or `grubbery` for a desk built by grubbery: its libs are translated on the way (below). |
| `CODE` | grubbery only: the code tree's root in the repo (e.g. `code`), which `/lib/...` imports are relative to. |
| `PRELUDE` | grubbery only: faces grubbery puts in every lib's subject that the libs use (e.g. `tarball`). Each becomes a `/+` at the top of every translated lib; ship a lib of that name with `FILES` (a shim of just the molds used is enough). |
| `TESTS` | a directory; every `*.hoon` in it lands in `tests/lib/`. |
| `FILES` | optional fixtures, landing at the same path on the desk, or `src=dest` to move one (`code/sur/x.hoon=sur/x.hoon`). |
| `MARKS` | marks copied from `%base` at setup. Default `json mime`: a `/*` of a json file needs both. |

The kit finds the config in the current directory or the nearest one above
it. `HOON_TEST_CONF=<path>` overrides that.

## Running

```sh
scripts/hoon-test-kit/hoon-test.sh <pier>                 # every suite
scripts/hoon-test-kit/hoon-test.sh <pier> <suite> ...     # by test file name, no .hoon
NOSYNC=1 scripts/hoon-test-kit/hoon-test.sh <pier>        # commit the mount as it stands

scripts/hoon-test-kit/hoon-mutate.py <pier> --list                   # size a run first
scripts/hoon-test-kit/hoon-mutate.py <pier>                          # boundary,conjunct
scripts/hoon-test-kit/hoon-mutate.py <pier> --ops branch,equal,flag
scripts/hoon-test-kit/hoon-mutate.py <pier> --only arm-a,arm-b       # recheck after a fix
```

`hoon-test.sh` exit codes:

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | every test passed |
| 1 | a test failed or crashed: the `FAILED`/`CRASHED` lines above say which, with expected and actual |
| 2 | nothing ran, or the run did not finish: the output says why |
| 3 | a lib did not build (named). The compiler's message is only on the ship's terminal: clay slogs it and answers `~`. |
| 4 | the ship did not answer. This is never a test verdict. |

`hoon-mutate.py` needs about 10 s **and one commit** per mutant, and every
commit costs the ship loom. Size a run with `--list` first, and run long
ones on a ship nothing else is building on (PLAYBOOK.md, "Look after the
ship").

## A grubbery app

Grubbery builds a desk's code itself, and its imports are not clay's:

| grubbery | on the test desk |
|---|---|
| `/<  face  /lib/a/b.hoon` | `/+  face=a-b` (ford finds `lib/a/b.hoon`) |
| `/<  *  /lib/a.hoon` | `/+  *a` |
| `/&  face  /lib/dir/` | one `/*  face-N  %mime  /lib/dir/<file>/<ext>` per file, and `face` bound to the `(axal (map @ta mime))` grubbery hands over; the files are copied along |
| `/&  face  /lib/x/f.txt` | `/*  face  %mime  /lib/x/f/txt` |

Other runes (`/$`, `/%`) and relative paths are refused by name, not
guessed at. Set `DIALECT=grubbery`, `CODE`, and `PRELUDE` for the faces
grubbery supplies (see the calendar's `hoon-test.conf` for a whole
example). A `/&` of text files needs their marks: `MARKS="json mime txt txt-diff"`.
The first build of a lib with hundreds of `/*` imports takes a minute or
more; later runs reuse it.

## Claude Code

`skill/hoon-test-kit/SKILL.md` teaches an agent to use the kit. Install it
for every project with:

```sh
ln -s ~/software/personal/hoon-test-kit/skill/hoon-test-kit ~/.claude/skills/hoon-test-kit
```

## Origin

Built for auspex on 2026-09-25. The first mutation runs found 26 real
gaps in a suite that already had 90 tests. `auspex/docs/hoon-testing.md`
is that case study.
